#Week1
- Truth tables were introduced to us. It is an important tool for the course itself.
- I also learned that we don`t need calculator in the subject unlike our other subjects.
- The "Knights and Knaves" problem was discussed.
- It`s different from other math subjects. 
- The variables that we usually use are p and q.

#Week2
- Quantifiers and tautology.
- Logical equivalences (De Morgans, Idempotent, Double Negation)
- A lot of hard problems were encountered this week.

#Week3
-On this week, we tackled proofs for our lesson.
-Method of proofs are hard and confusing.
-There are many proofs that we need to understand.

#Week4
-Mathematical induction was introduced to us this week. 
-Mathematical induction seems familiar because I`ve heard this one before in Engalg2.
-Counter example is needed in order to prove that a statement is wrong.

#Week5
-Program algorithms were introduced to us.
-I find it hard because I really suck when it comes to programming. 
-Sets were introduced to us too and I got the idea quickly.

#Week6
-Review of quantifiers was done.
-One to one function is a function that has a "unique" value.
