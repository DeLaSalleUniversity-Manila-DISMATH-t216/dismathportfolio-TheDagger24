#Week1
- Truth tables were introduced to us. It is an important tool for the course itself.
- I also learned that we don`t need calculator in the subject unlike our other subjects.
- The "Knights and Knaves" problem was discussed.
- It`s different from other math subjects. 
- The variables that we usually use are p and q.

#Week2
- Quantifiers and tautology.
- Logical equivalences (De Morgans, Idempotent, Double Negation)
- A lot of hard problems were encountered this week.

#Week3
-On this week, we tackled proofs for our lesson.
-Method of proofs are hard and confusing.
-There are many proofs that we need to understand.

#Week4
-Mathematical induction was introduced to us this week. 
-Mathematical induction seems familiar because I`ve heard this one before in Engalg2.
-Counter example is needed in order to prove that a statement is wrong.

#Week5
-Program algorithms were introduced to us.
-I find it hard because I really suck when it comes to programming. 
-Sets were introduced to us too and I got the idea quickly.
-Venn diagram was used to teach sets.


#Week6
-Review of quantifiers was done.
-There are three types of functions namely : One-to-one, Onto , and Bijection.
-One to one function is a function that has a "unique" value.
-Onto is a kind of function wherein the domain and the codomain are the same. Also,
-Bijection is a function that is both a one-to-one and onto function.

#Week7
-Searching algorithms were introduced to us.
-Linear and Binary search.
-Iteration table can be used in order to test a linear search.
-Binary search is done by dividing the data into two parts over and over again until it satisfies the condition.
-Pseudocode was also introduced.
-It is like LBYEC71 but is written in a piece of paper instead of using the computer.
-A dance involving algorithm was shown to us by Sir Melvin.


#Week8
- A new algorithm was introduced to us and it is for sorting.
- Bubble Sort Algorithm 
-   1. Successively comparing adjacent elements.
-   2. Interchange elements if they are in wrong order.
-   3. Repeat until there are elements.
-   Post Condition: It should be in increasing order.
- Insertion Sort Pseudocode was also discussed.
- Greedy Algorithm selects best choice at each step.

#Week9
- Growth of functions
