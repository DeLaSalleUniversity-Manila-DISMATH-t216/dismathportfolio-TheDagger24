#Week1
- Introduction to Dismath. It was cool at first.
- Thinking critically is mandatory for the course in order to pass it by the end of the term.
- Truth tables were introduced to us. It is an important tool for the course itself.
- I also learned that we don`t need calculator in the subject unlike our other subjects.
- The "Knights and Knaves" problem was discussed.
- It`s different from other math subjects. 
- The variables that we usually use are p and q.

#Week2
- Quantifiers and tautology.
- For the first part of the course, we`ll learn about proposition, logical connectives, logical deduction and premises.
- 1 = true and 0 = false.
- Logical equivalences (De Morgans, Idempotent, Double Negation)
-> Logical Connectives
- Negation (¬, not)
- Conjunction (∧, and)
- Disjunction (∨, or)
- Exclusive Or (⊕, xor)
- Conditional (→, if,then)
- Biconditional (↔, iff)
- A lot of hard problems were encountered this week.

#Week3
- On this week, we tackled proofs for our lesson.
- Method of proofs are hard and confusing.
- There are many proofs that we need to understand.

#Week4
- Mathematical induction was introduced to us this week. 
- Mathematical induction seems familiar because I`ve heard this one before in Engalg2.
- Counter example is needed in order to prove that a statement is wrong.

#Week5
- Program algorithms were introduced to us.
- I find it hard because I really suck when it comes to programming. 
- Sets were introduced to us too and I got the idea quickly.
- Venn diagram was used to teach sets.


#Week6
- Review of quantifiers was done.
- There are three types of functions namely : One-to-one, Onto , and Bijection.
- One to one function is a function that has a "unique" value.
- Onto is a kind of function wherein the domain and the codomain are the same. Also,
- Bijection is a function that is both a one-to-one and onto function.


#Week7
- Searching algorithms were introduced to us.
- Linear and Binary search.
- Iteration table can be used in order to test a linear search.
- Binary search is done by dividing the data into two parts over and over again until it satisfies the condition.
- Pseudocode was also introduced.
- It is like LBYEC71 but is written in a piece of paper instead of using the computer.
- A dance involving algorithm was shown to us by Sir Melvin.


#Week8
- A new algorithm was introduced to us and it is for sorting.
- Bubble Sort Algorithm 
-   1. Successively comparing adjacent elements.
-   2. Interchange elements if they are in wrong order.
-   3. Repeat until there are elements.
-   Post Condition: It should be in increasing order.
- Insertion Sort Pseudocode was also discussed.
- Greedy Algorithm selects best choice at each step.

#Week9
- Growth of functions
- Big Theta is the lower and upper bound of a function. It should be both Big O and Big Omega.
- Big O is the upper bound of a function. C is the constant and K is the intersection.
- Big omega is the lower bound of the function.
- Time complexity

#Week10
- No classes.

#Week11
- There were only 2 classes for quiz 3.
- For the 1st class. The Handshaking Theorem was introduced.
- Handshaking Theorem can be found by: 2e = Σdegrees (vertices)
- Euler Path and Circuit was introduced.
- Euler path - all edges must be used and it has a different starting and finishing point.
- Euler circuit - All adges must be used and Vo=V, meaning the starting and end point are just the same.
